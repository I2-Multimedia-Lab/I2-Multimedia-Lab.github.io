In this paper, we propose a set of significant improvements to patch-based point cloud compression, i.e., a learnable context model for entropy coding, octree coding for sampling centroid points, and an integrated compression and training process. In addition, we propose an adversarial network to improve the uniformity of points during reconstruction. Our experiments show that the improved patch-based autoencoder outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of rate-distortion performance, on both sparse and large-scale point clouds. More importantly, our method can maintain a short compression time while ensuring the reconstruction quality.</p>',
