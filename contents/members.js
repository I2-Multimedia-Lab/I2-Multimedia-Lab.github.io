I received my PhD degree in Electronic Engineering from University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia, luckily supervised by Prof. Wei Xiang and Prof. John Billingsley. During my PhD study, I spent two wonderful months as a visiting student at Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, Australia, working with Prof. Manoranjan Paul. My current research interests include Image Processing/Analysis, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence.",
